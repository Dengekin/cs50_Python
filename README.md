# cs50_Python
This repository contains my notes and examples from CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python. It covers everything from functions and variables to conditionals, loops, exceptions, libraries, unit testing, file I/O, regular expressions, and object-oriented programming. It also includes best practices and small projects for hands-on learning.

🐍 CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python

A collection of my notes, exercises, and small projects from Harvard’s CS50P — Introduction to Programming with Python.
This repository tracks my progress as I explore Python’s most essential concepts, from the basics to more advanced programming topics.

📘 Topics Covered

Functions & Variables – structuring programs and managing data

Conditionals & Loops – controlling program flow efficiently

Exceptions – handling runtime errors gracefully

Libraries – extending Python with built-in and third-party modules

Unit Tests – verifying code correctness through automated tests

File I/O – reading from and writing to external files

Regular Expressions – pattern matching and text processing

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – building reusable, modular code with classes and objects

Et Cetera – debugging, style, best practices, and mini projects

🧠 About the Course

CS50P is Harvard’s introduction to computer science and programming using Python.
It emphasizes problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and writing clean, readable code — providing a solid foundation for anyone entering software development.
