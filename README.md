# cs50_Python
This repository contains my notes and examples from CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python. It covers everything from functions and variables to conditionals, loops, exceptions, libraries, unit testing, file I/O, regular expressions, and object-oriented programming. It also includes best practices and small projects for hands-on learning.
