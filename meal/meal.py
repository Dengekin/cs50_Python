"""
Meal Time
breakfast between 7:00 and 8:00,
lunch between 12:00 and 13:00, and
dinner between 18:00 and 19:00.

#:## or ##:##.
#:## a.m. and ##:## a.m.
#:## p.m. and ##:## p.m.
For instance, whether itâ€™s 7:00, 7:01, 7:59, or 8:00, or anytime in between, itâ€™s time for breakfast.

convert is a function that converts time, a str in 24-hour format,
to the corresponding number of hours as a float.
For instance, given a time like "7:30" (i.e., 7 hours and 30 minutes),
convert should return 7.5 (i.e., 7.5 hours).
